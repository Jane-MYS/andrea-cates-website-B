              Meet Andrea: Your Myofunctional Therapist

              <p>
                With over 15 years of experience as a dental hygienist, I have seen firsthand how certain oral habits can impact long-term development and overall quality of life. My passion for helping patients led me to explore the transformative benefits of myofunctional therapy. After extensive research and advanced training, I began offering myofunctional therapy services in 2021.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am committed to a collaborative approach, working closely with dentists, orthodontists, chiropractors, and speech-language pathologists. By partnering with like-minded professionals, I strive to achieve lasting, effective results for every patient.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since incorporating myofunctional therapy into my practice, I've seen remarkable improvements in my patients' health, comfort, and quality of life.
